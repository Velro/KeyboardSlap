KeyboardSlap
============

Rhythm game using Libgdx and freesound.org samples.

If you're new to Libgdx, all logic code is kept in the top project folder, labelled LD27. The other project folders serve to compile and export to various platforms. So to compile for desktop, save all changes in the core file, then run the Main method in LD-27-desktop.

I know there is some serious spaghetti code in here.
